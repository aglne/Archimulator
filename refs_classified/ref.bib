	problem. It assumes that page sizes and page fault penalties are

	solution of this problem is an NP-complete problem. A dynamic programming
	algorithm that finds an optimal solution is presented. Since this
	algorithm is inefficient, we explore modified algorithms that allow
	a trade-off between optimality and speed},

	code for a simple, clean, orthogonal computer; no matter which awful
	machine they used to write their compilers. It was a very successful
	in this role. SPIM has since been used in a variety of other roles
	including the machine for teaching assembly language programming

  year = {2001},
  pages = {40-51},
  abstract = {Hardly predictable data addresses in many irregular applications have
	rendered prefetching ineffective, In many cases, the only accurate
	way to predict these addresses is to directly execute the code that
	generates them. As multithreaded architectures become increasingly
	popular, one attractive approach is to use idle threads on these
	machines to perform pre-execution - essentially a combined act of
	speculative address generation and prefetching - to accelerate the
	main thread. In this paper, we propose such a pre-execution technique
	for simultaneous multithreading (SMT) processors. By using software
	to control pre-execution, we are able to handle some of the Most
	important access patterns that are typically difficult to prefetch.
	Compared with existing work oil pre-execution, our technique is significantly
	simpler to implement (e.g., no integration of pre-execution results,
	no need of shortening programs for pre-execution, and no need of
	special hardware to copy register values upon thread spawns). Consequently,
	only minimal extensions to SMT machines are required to support our
	technique. Despite its simplicity, our technique offers an average
	speedup of 24% in a set of irregular applications, which is a 19%,
	speedup over state-of-the-art software-controlled prefetching.},

  pages = {191-200},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Most recent cache designs use direct-mapped caches to provide the
	fast access time required by modern high speed CPU{'}s. Unfortunately,
	direct-mapped caches have higher miss rates than set-associative
	caches, largely because direct-mapped caches are more sensitive to
	conflicts between items needed frequently in the same phase of program
	execution.This paper presents a new technique for reducing direct-mapped
	cache misses caused by conflicts for a particular cache line. A small
	finite state machine recognizes the common instruction reference
	patterns where storing an instruction in the cache actually harms
	performance. Such instructions are dynamically excluded, that is
	they are passed directly through the cache without being stored.
	This reduces misses to the instructions that would have been replaced.The
	effectiveness of dynamic exclusion is dependent on the severity of
	cache conflicts and thus on the particular program and cache size
	of interest. However, across the SPEC benchmarks, simulation results
	show an average reduction in miss rate of 33% for a 32KB instruction
	cache with 16B lines. In addition, applying dynamic exclusion to
	one level of a cache hierarchy can improve the performance of the
	next level since instructions do not need to be stored on both levels.
	Finally, dynamic exclusion also improves combined instruction and
	data cache miss rates.},

  title = {Instruction-based Reuse Distance Prediction Replacement Policy},
  year = {2010},
  __markedentry = {[itecgo:1]},
  abstract = {This paper presents a new cache replacement policy based on Instruction-based
	Reuse Distance Prediction (IbRDP) Replacement Policy originally proposed
	by Keramidas, Petoumenos, and Kaxiras [5] and further optimized by
	Petoumenos et al. [6]. In these works [5,6] we have proven that there
	is a strong correlation between the temporal characteristics of the
	cache blocks and the access patterns of instructions (PCs) that touch
	these cache blocks. Based on this observation we introduced a new
	class of instruction-based predictors which are able to directly
	predict with high accuracy at run-time when a cache block is going
	to be accessed in the future, a.k.a. the reuse distance of a cache
	block. Being able to predict the reuse distances of the cache blocks
	permits us to make near-optimal replacement decisions by "lookingintothefuture."
	In this work, we employ an extension of the IbRDP Replacement policy
	[6]. We carefully re-design the organization as well as the functionality
	of the predictor and the corresponding replacement algorithm in order
	to fit into the tight area budget provided by the CRC committee [3].
	Since our proposal naturally supports the ability to victimize the
	currently fetched blocks by not caching them at all in the cache
	(Selective Caching), we submit for evaluation two versions: the base-IbRDP
	and the IbRDP enhanced with Selective Caching (IbRDP+SC). Our performance
	evaluations based on a subset of SPEC2006 applications show that
	IbRDP achieves an IPC improvement of 4.66% (arithmetic average) over
	traditional LRU, while IbRDP+SC is able to further increase its distance
	compared to the baseline LRU to 6.04%. Finally, we also show that
	IbRDP outperforms the previous state of the art proposal (namely
	Dynamic Insertion Policy or DIP [7]) by 2.32% in terms of IPC (3.81%
	for the IbRDP+SC).},

  abstract = {Compiling for distributed-memory machines has been a very active research
	area in recent years. Much of this work has concentrated on programs
	that use arrays as their primary data structures. To date, little
	work has been done to address the problem of supporting programs
	that use pointer-based dynamic data structures. The techniques developed
	for supporting SPMD execution of array-based programs rely on the
	fact that arrays are statically defined and directly addressable.
	Recursive data structures do not have these properties, so new techniques
	must be developed. In this article, we describe an execution model
	for supporting programs that use pointer-based dynamic data structures.
	This model uses a simple mechanism for migrating a thread of control
	based on the layout of heap-allocated data and introduces parallelism
	using a technique based on futures and lazy task creation. We intend
	to exploit this execution model using compiler analyses and automatic
	parallelization techniques. We have implemented a prototype system,
	which we call \em Olden, that runs on the Intel iPSC/860 and the
	Thinking Machines CM-5. We discuss our implementation and report
	on experiments with five benchmarks.},
