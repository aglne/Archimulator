	Abstract = {Prefetching algorithms have been mainly studied in the context of the Coverage and Accuracy metrics. While this is an appropriate metric for prefetching into separate stream buffers, it is a poor assessment of prefetching into a shared cache structure where cache pollution can become a serious factor. Traditionally, prefetches have been categorized as "good" or "bad" if they are accessed or are evicted without being accessed, respectively. We propose a new categorization of "good", "bad", and "ugly" that takes into account prefetches that cause harmful cache pollution. This paper proposes a novel structure called the Evict Table (ET) that gauges the amount of cache pollution caused by prefetching into a shared data structure, such as a cache. We show the value of the ET in the context of a chip-multiprocessors, where prefetching among several processing nodes may further increase the contention for cache real-estate. Specifically, we use the ET as an aid in evaluating the effects of Unistride and Czone prefetching algorithms on a chip-multiprocessor{'}s shared L2 cache across a varying number of cache sizes. 1 1},

@Misc{Petoumenos2010,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new cache replacement policy based on Instruction-based Reuse Distance Prediction (IbRDP) Replacement Policy originally proposed by Keramidas, Petoumenos, and Kaxiras [5] and further optimized by Petoumenos et al. [6]. In these works [5,6] we have proven that there is a strong correlation between the temporal characteristics of the cache blocks and the access patterns of instructions (PCs) that touch these cache blocks. Based on this observation we introduced a new class of instruction-based predictors which are able to directly predict with high accuracy at run-time when a cache block is going to be accessed in the future, a.k.a. the reuse distance of a cache block. Being able to predict the reuse distances of the cache blocks permits us to make near-optimal replacement decisions by "lookingintothefuture." In this work, we employ an extension of the IbRDP Replacement policy [6]. We carefully re-design the organization as well as the functionality of the predictor and the corresponding replacement algorithm in order to fit into the tight area budget provided by the CRC committee [3]. Since our proposal naturally supports the ability to victimize the currently fetched blocks by not caching them at all in the cache (Selective Caching), we submit for evaluation two versions: the base-IbRDP and the IbRDP enhanced with Selective Caching (IbRDP+SC). Our performance evaluations based on a subset of SPEC2006 applications show that IbRDP achieves an IPC improvement of 4.66% (arithmetic average) over traditional LRU, while IbRDP+SC is able to further increase its distance compared to the baseline LRU to 6.04%. Finally, we also show that IbRDP outperforms the previous state of the art proposal (namely Dynamic Insertion Policy or DIP [7]) by 2.32% in terms of IPC (3.81% for the IbRDP+SC).},
