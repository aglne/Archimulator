Archimulator models inclusive caches.

The inclusion property requires that the contents of all the
smaller caches of a multi-level cache hierarchy be a subset of
the last-level cache (LLC).

When a line is evicted from the
LLC, inclusion is enforced by removing that line from all the
caches in the hierarchy. We refer to cache lines invalidated in
the small caches as a result of inclusion as inclusion victims.
