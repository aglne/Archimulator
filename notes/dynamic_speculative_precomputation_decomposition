1. Identifying and Tracking Delinquent Loads

DLIT - Delinquent Load Identification Table, FCFS
	the PC of the load
	the PC of the call instruction which invoked the function that contains the load
	
	1. static loads which missed in L2 on their most execution
	2. after a load occupies an entry for 128K total committed instructions, it's evaluated for delinquency
	3. a load is considered delinquent if, over the previous 128K instructions, it had been executed at least 100 times,
		and, on average, each instance, spent 4 or more cycles as the oldest instruction in its thread, waiting for its memory request to be satisfied
	4. when a load is found to be delinquent, it's passed on to the next phase and its entry locked into the DLIT

2. Hardware to Construct P-Slices
	
RIB - Retired instruction Buffer, FIFO of 512 entries
	the PC
	logical source and destination register numbers
	"marked" bit

3. Hardware to Spawn and Manage P-slices

SIT - Slice Information Table
	PCs of instructions contained in a slice
	
4. optional slice cache residing besides L1I cache
