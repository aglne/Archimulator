Macro TODO List (blueprint) for my Ph.D study:

(priority listing: 1 -> 3: critical -> trivial)

a. For helper threaded prefetching:

	1. identification of good, bad and ugly prefetches (via mechanisms such as prefetch evictee table)
		priority: 1
		my previous work: extending GEMS to support measurement of prefetch coverage and accuracy
		current state of my work: initial work done
		
	2. cache replacement/prefetch filtering(bypassing)/prefetch thread progress control(throttling & synchronization with main thread)
		(based on the history and prediction of good, bad and ugly prefetches)
		priority: 1
		my previous work: clone of rereference prediction based cache replacement policies in Archimulator
		current state of my work: pending
		
	3. interaction with h/w prefetching
		priority: 3
		my previous work: extending GEMS to support simple H/W strided prefetching
		current state of my work: pending	
			
	4. MLP-awareness to the above all
		priority: 2
		my previous work: extending GEMS to support MLP & BLP-related metrics collection and for prefetch threading scheme in specific
		current state of my work: pending
		
	5. define and support collecting/predicting appropriate metrics for evaluating memory subsystem in general and prefetch threading in special
		priority: 1
		my previous work:
		current state of my work: literature study

b. For Archimulator simulator:

	1. improving accuracy
		priority: 1
		my previous work: simulation result comparison with Multi2Sim, GEMS
		current state of my work: literature study
		
	2. improving speed
		priority: 3
		my previous work: use Java specific profilers to find hotspots in Archimulator and reduce simulation time purposefully to some extent
		current state of my work: literature study
		
	3. support sampled simulation (statistical simulation is abandoned for resource limitation)
		priority: 1
		my previous work: general framework done in Archimulator, switching from fast forward to detailed simulation mode
		current state of my work: literature study; state-of-the-art microarchitecture warmup mechanisms pending
		
	4. support parallel simulation
		priority: 3
		my previous work: (NONE)
		current state of my work: literature study
		
	5. comparison to other mainstream and emerging multicore architectural simulators
		priority: 1
		my previous work: (NONE)
		current state of my work: pending
