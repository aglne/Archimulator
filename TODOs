    Predicting Inter-Thread Cache Contention on a Chip Multi-Processor Architecture

Hints from Cache showndown: the good, bad and ugly:
    Useful prefetches are those that are actually accessed, while harmful prefetches are those that are never accessed
    and are a direct cause of misses to cache lines that were displaced by that prefetch line. Finally, useless
    prefetches are those that are never accessed.

    At any point in execution, the union of the non-prefetched tags in the cache and the evict tags in the ET give the state of of cache as if prefetching had never occurred.
