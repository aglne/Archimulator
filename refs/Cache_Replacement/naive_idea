A Wrong-Path Aware Replacement Policy

Our second proposed enhancement is to make the
cache replacement policy wrong-path aware. To
accomplish this, when a block is brought into the cache, it
is marked as being either on the correct-path or on the
wrong-path. (There are several possible ways to design
such a mechanism, but they are beyond the scope of this
paper.) Later, when a block needs to be evicted from that
set in the cache, assuming that all cache blocks are valid
(if not, an invalid block is “replaced” first), wrong-path
blocks are evicted first, on a LRU basis if there are
multiple wrong-path blocks. However, a wrong-path block
that services a correct path reference is marked as if it was
on the correct-path, thus excluding it from the wrong-path
replacement policy. If all cache blocks originated from a
correct-path reference, then the LRU block in that set is
chosen for eviction.
