Replacement algorithms in selecting victim lines in
a cache congruence class (set) should also be designed
carefully. When prefetched lines are placed in the re-
gular cache, high frequency of prefetching can increase
replacing useful cache lines. Casmira et al.[21] proposed
Prefetch Buffer Filter (PBF), a small fully associative
buffer, to reduce the effect of cache pollution. This
buffer holds a prefetched cache line in PBF until it is ac-
cessed for the first time. Then, the prefetched cache line
is moved into cache. Jain et al.[41] suggested using soft-
ware instructions to augment LRU replacement policy.
These instructions allow a program to evict a cache ele-
ment by making it the least recently used element or to
keep a cache element in the cache. Replacement poli-
cies that select victims based on both frequency and re-
cency of accesses, such as Adaptive Replacement Cache
(ARC)[42] can also reduce cache pollution.
